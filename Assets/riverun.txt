Do we need easing or “fade?in” of each tile?

How long per tile delay looks good? (e.g. 0.05s?)

Camera setup: will you use an orthographic camera sized exactly to 9:16, or simply parent everything under a Canvas?

Prefab lookup: you could expose a small List<PartPrefab> in the inspector or build a runtime Dictionary<string, Sprite> from a Resources folder.


1. Not at the moment.
2. you can put for now 0.05
3. everything will be in 3D - i cant make a train turn in 2D - so it wont be in canvas it will be in scene - you can add a MainHolder Transform searializedField and put all in there
4. not sure we need a list - just a single Prefab PartPrefab - that will have TrackPartView and can be inited to any of the shapes we have in dict.
